## Summary

This EHandBook is a Mobile App I built for 'The Children Center of NY'. The App is owned by HR and to be distributed to TCCNY's employees.  

The purpose of the program is to strengthen and expand my skills as a Full Stack developer. The completed work is showcased on my GitHub and portfolio/personal website.  

My ultimate goal is to land a job that incorporates my skills and utilizes my abilities and outgoing personality. So if you enjoyed reviewing my code as much as I did writing it, please find me on one of the links provided below.
